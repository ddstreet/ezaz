LATER/CLEANUP:

- add spinner to az calls

- command actionconfigs should pass opts and also cmd_opts to command handler functions

- add full ancestor path of object anme params for commands missing
  them (where currently uses just one object name param)

- add config/params to debug per-module/per-class, e.g. debug-cache

- review use of 'opts' vs '**opts' in methods; should try to be consistent

- update setup command to allow creating from prompt command

- create commands could swallow the returned json and update info cache

- global enable/disable caching configuration setting

- change --no-cache option to disable both r/w caching, add
  --update-cache (w only) and --read-cache (read only) or some names
  like that

DOCS:

- filtering
- defaults
- add help description/submmary/etc to each subcommand
