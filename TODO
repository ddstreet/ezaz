- azobjects should have simple api, e.g. create(), delete(), show(),
  etc. that can be called directly and simply without opts()

- implement vm actions
  add 'get-instance-view' for vm current/instance info (running, distro, etc)

- implement image upload, in imageversion (alias image?)

- change 'set' and 'clear', to just 'default' action
  params are obj id or '--remove' or '--none' or something to remove default

- update Config to be subclassable
- change Filter/Filters to subclass of Config

- change subscription to print warning if current != default?
  not sure, we always provide the default subscription to az cmds...
  maybe the 'current' sub doesn't make any difference, except to 'ezaz az' cmds?

- move param config stuff into azobject subclasses, so we don't have
  to keep separate param config that needs to match each other

DOCS:

- FilterActionCommand
  - add better doc in help output
  - show parts correctly
  - implement showing of parent hierarchy

- add help description/submmary/etc to each subcommand
