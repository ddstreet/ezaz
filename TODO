- implement vm actions

- implement image upload, in imageversion (alias image?)

- update Config to be subclassable
- change Filter/Filters to subclass of Config

- change subscription to print warning if current != default?
  not sure, we always provide the default subscription to az cmds...
  maybe the 'current' sub doesn't make any difference, except to 'ezaz az' cmds?

- move param config stuff into azobject subclasses, so we don't have
  to keep separate param config that needs to match each other

DOCS:

- FilterActionCommand
  - add better doc in help output
  - show parts correctly
  - implement showing of parent hierarchy

- add help description/submmary/etc to each subcommand
