- update setup command
  allow creating from prompt command
  create cache expiries

- update config param to allow simple strings which default to a filename in normal config dir

LATER/CLEANUP:

- command actionconfigs should pass opts and also cmd_opts to command handler functions

- add full ancestor path of object anme params for commands missing
  them (where currently uses just one object name param)

- add config/params to debug per-module/per-class, e.g. debug-cache

- review use of 'opts' vs '**opts' in methods; should try to be consistent

DOCS:

- filtering
- defaults
- add help description/submmary/etc to each subcommand
