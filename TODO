LATER/CLEANUP:

- add spinner to az calls

- command actionconfigs should pass opts and also cmd_opts to command handler functions

- add full ancestor path of object anme params for commands missing
  them (where currently uses just one object name param)

- add config/params to debug per-module/per-class, e.g. debug-cache

- review use of 'opts' vs '**opts' in methods; should try to be consistent

- update setup command to allow creating from prompt command

- create commands could swallow the returned json and update info cache

- global enable/disable caching configuration setting

- change --no-cache option to disable both r/w caching, add
  --update-cache (w only) and --read-cache (read only) or some names
  like that

- add support for displaying vm usage (az vm usage)

- fix marketplace image version 'show' details - content is different between 'show' and 'list'

- show clarifying error msg during 'setup' if no local ssh key to upload
- in setup, do not create image gallery or storage account
- in 'image create', automatically create image gallery and/or storage
  account if needed, possibly requring parameter to do so (default to
  not creating them?)
- in setup, change naming to include local hostname
- in setup, change sshkey naming to include key type

- check all node types for name restrictions (max length, chars allowed, etc)
